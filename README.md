"Excel DATA analysis project" in two parts comprising of Data cleaning, Data Shaping, use of pivot tables.
It is a project work which I completed to get my certificate for excel basics of data analytics.The project is divided into two parts.In first part i did data cleaning and in second part I did analysis with the help of pivot tables.
in data cleaning parts i sorted the width of the columns so the data is visible, corrected the spelling mistakes, removed the empty rows, removed the duplicated rows where necesssary(using conditional formating).
In part 2 I, formated the data as table and created pivot tables.
